## 🛡️ Antivirus False Positive Solutions

> **Important:** If your antivirus software flags `SpeedyHighway.exe` as suspicious, this is a **FALSE POSITIVE**.

### Why This Happens

- PyInstaller bundles Python runtime, which some antivirus software incorrectly flags
- The executable is unsigned, which triggers heuristic detection
- This is a **very common issue** with Python executables

### Our Antivirus Compatibility Measures

✅ Enhanced metadata with proper company information  
✅ Disabled UPX compression (reduces false positives)  
✅ Standard executable structure without obfuscation  
✅ Comprehensive version information and file descriptions  
✅ Clear file origins and purpose documentation  

### Solutions

#### 1. 🔒 Whitelist the File (Recommended)

Add `SpeedyHighway.exe` to your antivirus whitelist/exclusions:

- **Windows Defender**: Virus & threat protection → Exclusions → Add file
- **McAfee**: Real-Time Scanning → Excluded Files → Add `SpeedyHighway.exe`
- **Norton**: Settings → Antivirus → Exclusions → Configure → Add `SpeedyHighway.exe`

#### 2. ✅ Verify the File is Safe

- **File name**: `SpeedyHighway.exe`
- **Publisher**: WARlord05 Games
- **Description**: Speedy Highway Racing Game - Enhanced Edition
- **Version**: 1.1.0
- **Source**: Built from open source Python code with antivirus compatibility features

#### 3. 🔄 Verification Steps

1. Check file properties - should show version info and publisher
2. File size should be approximately 27-30 MB
3. Scan with multiple antivirus engines online (like VirusTotal)
4. Source code is available for review on GitHub
5. Executable is located in root folder (`SpeedyHighway.exe`)
